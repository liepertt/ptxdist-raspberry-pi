Subject: [PATCH 171/204] BCM270X_DT: mz61581: Revert to spi-bcm2708
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The MZ61581 display does not work with spi-bcm2835 and software
chip select. It works before the commit:
spi: bcm2835: transform native-cs to gpio-cs on first spi_setup

Revert to spi-bcm2708 until the cause has been detected and the
issue resolved.
