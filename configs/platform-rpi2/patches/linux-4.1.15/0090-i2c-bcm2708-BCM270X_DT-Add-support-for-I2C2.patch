Subject: [PATCH 090/204] i2c-bcm2708/BCM270X_DT: Add support for I2C2

The third I2C bus (I2C2) is normally reserved for HDMI use. Careless
use of this bus can break an attached display - use with caution.

It is recommended to disable accesses by VideoCore by setting
hdmi_ignore_edid=1 or hdmi_edid_file=1 in config.txt.

The interface is disabled by default - enable using the
i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing DT parameter.
